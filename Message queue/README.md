# Message Queue
A message queue is a linked list of messages stored within the kernel and identified by a message queue identifier. A new queue is created or an existing queue opened by msgget().  
New messages are added to the end of a queue by msgsnd(). Every message has a positive long integer type field, a non-negative length, and the actual data bytes (corresponding to the length), 
all of which are specified to msgsnd() when the message is added to a queue. Messages are fetched from a queue by msgrcv(). We donâ€™t have to fetch the messages in a first-in, first-out order. 
Instead, we can fetch messages based on their type field.

#### Objective
Communication between independent processes using Message Queues. It contains two programs msgq_server.c and msgq_client.c.  

1. msgq_server -
  - creates a message queue  
  - reads message from queue for an integer.
  - converts integer to binary format and writes it to the queue.  

2. msgq_client - 
  - attaches itself to the queue  
  - prompts user to enter an integer and writes it to the queue.
  - reads the binary format sent from the server on the queue

The program allows one to many communication i.e, many clients can communicate with the server (client number should be unique).
